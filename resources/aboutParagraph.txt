I am currently a third-year Software Engineering student at the University of Western Ontario. I was introduced to programming in a grade 10 computer science course, and I’ve loved programming ever since. There is an endless amount of creative possibilities of the products that can be created through programming and many solutions require problem-solving, creativity and innovation which is why I love programming even more. Not only is there an endless amount of products that can be created through programming, but programming is a powerful tool that can be used to positively impact the lives of others. I’ve always wanted to develop a product or service that can greatly influence the lives of others, and I know I can do this through programming.
